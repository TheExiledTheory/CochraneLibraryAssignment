# Cochrane Library Assignment 

This project was a project that I completed for a recruiter from an unnamed organization. This program took me a little over 4 days of on-and-off work to complete. Sadly, I didn't end up getting selected for the position. With that, I figured I would publish my hard work here. As with any tool that scrapes webpage elements - the application can break by any change made on the specified website.
